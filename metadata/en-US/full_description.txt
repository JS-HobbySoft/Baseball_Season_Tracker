I originally created this app to track my kid's baseball games, then expanded it to keep a record of each game in the season.  Your team name can be entered in the Settings menu and it will be entered into each new game.  The fields will increment and reset in a logical way (e.g., if there are 2 outs and you hit the "+ out" button again it will reset the outs/balls/strikes, if you hit the "+ hit" button it will also reset the balls/strikes, etc).   Entries in the Season Tracker screen can be deleted by long pressing.  Short pressing will show the runs, hits, and game notes.   

This app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.
